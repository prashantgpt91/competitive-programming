<p>After solving "AP - Complete The Series (easy)" very fast, Lucifer decided to make it little more interesting.</p> 
<p>He said</p> 
<p>He will be give you the 3rd term , 4th last term and the sum of the AP series. You need print length of the series &amp; the series.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.</p> 
<p>Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3term' ,'4Lastterm' and 'sum'</p> 
<p>3term  - is the 3rd term in the series and</p> 
<p>4Lastterm  - is the 4th last term in the series and</p> 
<p>sum - is the sum of the series.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.</p> 
<p>fist line should have 1 value- number of terms in the series.</p> 
<p>2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single space.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
<br>1<br>3 7 55<br><strong><br><br>Output:</strong><br>10<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br><strong><br>NOTE </strong>- In all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.<br>The series will have at least 7 elements.<br>number of test cases &lt;=100.<br>All the numbers will fit in 64 bits(long long in C)</pre>
