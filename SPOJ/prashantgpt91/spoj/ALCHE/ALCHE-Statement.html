<p>Alchemy is a discipline that is believed to span at least 2500 years of human history.<br>It is most known for its intention of transforming matter, typically trying to come up<br>with a recipe to make gold based on much less valued metals, aided by some non-metal<br>components.<br>Most scientists and scholars think that alchemy has failed. They surely do not know that<br>a particular alchemist named Albert Ainstain, managed to create gold from a simple<br>combination of ordinary iron (much more common and cheap than gold) and some good-<br>old-fashioned water. However, the combination must have the exact proportion of grams<br>of iron and centiliters of water to work, otherwise the alchemist would end up with useless<br>rusty iron.<br>Many alchemists and bussinessman had tried to recreate Albert Ainstain’s findings to<br>achieve recognition, fame, prestige or economical welfare, but none of them have suceeded.<br>Since you know very little about chemistry, alchemy and ancient practices, you believe<br>that your chances for success in this task are bounded to using a computer in your benefit.<br>Therefore, you decide to create a program that automatically tests a given combination<br>of iron and water, and informs whether that combination has the correct proportion<br>to produce gold. Of course, once you find the right proportion, you can double both<br>amounts and get double the gold, cut both in half and get half the gold, or multiply both<br>by any other real number to obtain the amount of gold you want. Your task is then,<br>given the number of grams of iron and the number of centiliters of water, say whether<br>the proportion between both components is the right one.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line<br>contains two integers I and W separated by a single space, representing grams of iron<br>and centiliters of water, respectively (1 ≤ I, W ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> ). The last line of the input contains<br>the number −1 twice separated by a single space and should not be processed as a test<br>case.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase “Y” if the combination<br>produces gold, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.</p>
