 There are N students in a class.

 All the students have different expertise in giving proxies(I hope this term is clear).

 Precisely, we associate an integer P with every student which denotes the number of proxies he can make.

<p>A Proxy in context of class attendance refers to the act when a student who is present in a class makes attendance for a student who is absent in the same class.</p> 
<p>There are N students in a class.</p> 
<p>All the students have different expertise in giving proxies.</p> 
<p>Precisely, we associate an integer P with every student which denotes the number of proxies he can make. </p> 
<p>All students are capable of making proxies for any other student.</p>

<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>First line contains an integer N(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000000) denoting the total number of students.</p> 
<p>Then, N lines follow each containing an integer Ai(1 &lt;= Ai &lt;= 100). The integer Ai on the ith line denotes the number of proxies that the ith student can make.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Print the minimum number of students that can be present in the class such that by giving proxies the recorded attendance can be 100%.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
5</pre> 
<pre>1</pre> 
<pre>3</pre> 
<pre>2</pre> 
<pre>1</pre> 
<pre>2

<strong>Output:</strong>
2</pre> 
<p>Explanation, one possible solution is that the first and second student are present. Now first student can give 1 proxy and second can give 2 proxies making the recorded attendance 5.</p>
