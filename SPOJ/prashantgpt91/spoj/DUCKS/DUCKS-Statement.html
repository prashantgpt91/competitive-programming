<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ducky the Duck was walking by and he had a little idea, he wanted to see if making a line of dots with his pencil and throwing the letters of his name randomly at it he would be able to pick up the letters again and writte his name perfectly, but some times when he throws them they fall out of the path. Ducky also throwed random characters to replace some of the dots, when he reaches a random character before he find his name he gets mad and scream NO DUCKY!, task is simple, just find Ducky´s name on the path he made.</span></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Clarifications:<br>1-Ducky starts looking for his name from the begining of the string</span></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">2-Ducky want to find the letters of his name that means 'D' 'u' 'c' 'k' 'y' another letter even the letter 'd' is considered a random character</span></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">3-When he steps a dot he will keep searching for the name, if he steps a letter of his name and hasn´t found them all he will keep searching, when he finds a random character he will stop.<br></span></span></p>
