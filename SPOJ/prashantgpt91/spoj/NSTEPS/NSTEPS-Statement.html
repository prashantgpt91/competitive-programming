<p>Starting from point (0,0) on a plane, we have written all non-negative integers 0, 1, 2,... as shown in the figure. For example, 1, 2, and 3 has been written at points (1,1), (2,0), and (3, 1) respectively and this pattern has continued.</p>

<p><br><br>You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y) coordinates in the input are in the range 0...10000.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x, y) of a point.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write No Number if there is none.</p> 
<p> </p>
