<p>Similar to that of the problem <a href="https://www.spoj.com/problems/INTEST/">Enormous Input Test</a>, the purpose of this problem is to determine whether your method of reading input data and writing output data is fast enough to process extremely large test cases.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>), denoting the number of lines to follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b (|a|, |b| ≤ 40,000).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each pair a and b, write a single line of output containing the value of a × b.</p>
