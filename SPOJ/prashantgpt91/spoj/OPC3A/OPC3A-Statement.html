<p>Arya is very fond of fibonacci numbers.He claimed he can solve any problem on fibonacci number.His clever friend golu gave him a challenge </p>
<p>to prove his skills.He gave him a sequence which he called exponacci.The sequence is given by <br><strong>g(n)=2^f(n-1) </strong>for n&gt;0 <br><strong>g(0)=1 </strong>for n==0 <br>f(n) denotes the nth fibonacci number where <br>f(0)=1 <br>f(1)=1 (Obviously golu is not as good as arya in fibonacci numbers so he believes f(0)=1,anyways we have chosen not to disturb him)<br>f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n&gt;1 <br>Help arya to find the nth exponacci number.Since the numbers can be very large take mod 10^9+7</p> 
<p><strong>Input :</strong> <br>The first line of the input will be the number of test cases(T&lt;=2000). For each test case first line contains one integers n 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000</p> 
<p><strong>Output :</strong><br>The value of g(n)%(10^9+7)</p>
