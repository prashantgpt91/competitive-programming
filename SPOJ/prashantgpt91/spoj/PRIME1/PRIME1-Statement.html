<p> Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers! </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t&lt;=10). In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000000, n-m&lt;=100000) separated by a space. </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m &lt;= p &lt;= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><b>Input:</b>
2
1 10
3 5

<b>Output:</b>
2
3
5
7

3
5
</pre> 
<b>Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages (though most should be OK if the algorithm is well designed)</b>
