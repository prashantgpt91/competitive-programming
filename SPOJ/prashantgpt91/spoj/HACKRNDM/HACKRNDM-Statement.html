<p>You recently wrote a random number generator code for a web application and now you notice that some cracker has cracked it. It now gives numbers at a difference of some given value k more predominantly. You being a hacker decide to write a code that will take in n numbers as input and a value k and find the total number of pairs of numbers whose absolute difference is equal to k, in order to assist you in your random number generator testing.</p> 
<p>NOTE: All values fit in the range of a signed integer, n, k&gt;=1</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>1st line contains n &amp; k.<br>2nd line contains n numbers of the set. All the n numbers are assured to be distinct.</p> 
<p>(<b>Edited: </b> n &lt;= 10^5)</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>One integer saying the no of pairs of numbers that have a diff k.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
5 2<br>1 5 3 4 2

<strong>Output:</strong>
3</pre>
