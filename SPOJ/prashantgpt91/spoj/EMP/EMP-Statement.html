<p>On some island each inhabitant is either a knight who only tells the truth, or a liar who always lies. Also, on the island there exists a university of technology where some of the inhabitants work. All of the university employees will always tell you the following two things, no matter which employee you ask:<br><br> </p>
<center>
  1. There are fewer than 
 <i>N</i> employees who work more than me.
</center>
<br>
<br> 
<center>
  2. At least 
 <i>M</i> employees of the university have a larger salary than me.
</center>
<br>
<br> 
<p> It is also known that no two employees of the university have an identical salary, and no two work equally. Write a program which will compute how many persons are employed by this university. <br> </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The only input line contains two integers <i>N</i> and <i>M</i>, with one space between them [<i>N, M</i> &lt;= 1000000000].</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> The output must contain only one integer - the total number of employees of this university, or 0 if there is no way to find the number of employees.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
1 1

<b>Output:</b>
2
</pre>
