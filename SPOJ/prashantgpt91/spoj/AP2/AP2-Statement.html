<p>Arithmatic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths.</p> 
<p>Arithmatic progression(AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 .... In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.</p> 
<p>The task here is very simple indeed.</p> 
<p>You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need print length of the series &amp; the series.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.</p> 
<p>Each of the following <b>t</b> lines will have 3 number '3term' ,'3Lastterm' and 'sum'</p> 
<p>3term  - is the 3rd term in of the series and</p> 
<p>3Lastterm  - is the 3rd term in of the series and</p> 
<p>sum - is the sum of the series.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.</p> 
<p>First line should have 1 value - the number of terms in the series.</p> 
<p>2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single space.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
1
3 8 55

<strong>Output:</strong>
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</pre> 
<p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> </p>
<ul> 
 <li>In all the test cases, all the series elements are positive integers.</li> 
 <li>The series will have at least 7 elements.</li> 
 <li>number of test cases &lt;=100.</li> 
 <li>All the numbers will fit in 64 bits (long long in C)</li> 
</ul>
