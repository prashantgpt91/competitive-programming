<p align="justify"> Given the length of side a of a triangle and the distances from the centroid (the point of concurrence of the medians - red in the picture) to all sides: a, b and c, calculate this triangle's area and the distance (blue line) from the orthocenter (the point of concurrence of the heights - green in the picture) to the centroid. </p>

<h3>Input</h3> 
<p align="justify"> In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). The next n lines - 4 floating point values: the length of side a, and distances from the centroid to sides a, b and c. </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p align="justify"> n lines consisting of 2 floating point values with 3 digits after the decimal point: the area of the triangle and the distance from the orthocenter to centroid. </p>
