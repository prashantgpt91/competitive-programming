<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The input consists of several instances. There is an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200) in the first line; it stands for the number of instances. The first line of each instance contains two integers, K and M (8 ≤ K ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ M ≤ 50) representing, respectively, the maximum weight the truck can handle and the amount of bags in the bank. The next M lines describe each bag with two integers A and B (8 ≤ A ≤ 200 and 1 ≤ B ≤ 25): the weight and the value of the bag, respectively.</p>
