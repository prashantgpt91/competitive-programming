<p> In front of Super Mario there are <b>10 mushrooms</b>, arranged in a row. A certain amount of points is awarded for picking each of the mushrooms. Super Mario must pick mushrooms <b>in order</b> they appear, but is not required to pick them all â€“ his goal is to score a number of points <b>as close as possible to 100</b>.</p> 
<p>In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98 and 102), Mario will pick the <b>greater</b> one (in this case 102).</p> 
<p>Help Super Mario and tell him how many points he will score.</p>
