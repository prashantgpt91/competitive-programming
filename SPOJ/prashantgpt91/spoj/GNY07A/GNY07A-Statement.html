<p>Misspelling is an art form that students seem to excel at. Write a program that removes the nth character from an input string. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow. </p>
<p>Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing M, a space, and a single word made up of uppercase letters only. M will be less than or equal to the length of the word. The length of the word is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 80. </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the misspelled word. The misspelled word is the input word with the indicated character deleted. </p>
