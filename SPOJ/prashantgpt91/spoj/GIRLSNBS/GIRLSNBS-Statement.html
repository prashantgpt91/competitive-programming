<p>There are G girl students and B boy students in a class that is about to graduate. You<br>need to arrange them in a single row for the graduation. To give a better impression of<br>diversity, you want to avoid having too many girls or too many boys seating consecutively.<br>You decided to arrange the students in order to minimize the gender regularity. The<br>gender regularity of an arrangement is the maximum number of students of the same<br>gender (all girls or all boys) that appear consecutively.<br>Given G and B, calculate the minimum gender regularity among all possible arrange-<br>ments.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Each test case is described using a single line. The line contains two integers G and B<br>representing the number of girls and boys in the class, respectively (0 ≤ G, B ≤ 1000).<br>The end of input is indicated with a line containing the number −1 twice.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, output a single line with a single integer representing the minimum<br>gender regularity that an arrangement of G girls and B boys can have.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> <br>10 10<br>5 1<br>0 1000<br>-1 -1
<br><strong>Output:</strong> <br>1<br>3<br>1000</pre>
