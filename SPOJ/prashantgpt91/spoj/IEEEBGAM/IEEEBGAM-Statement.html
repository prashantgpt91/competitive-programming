<p>Taru and Hanaku play a ball game. The game is played with N white balls, N black balls and N boxes. Hanaku chooses one box randomly and one ball from it randomly. Taru has to arrange the balls in such a way that the probability of Hanaku choosing a White ball is maximised. None of the boxes after the arrangement should be empty. Your task is to find that maximum probability.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line contains the number of test cases (T) followed by T lines each an integer N.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3>
