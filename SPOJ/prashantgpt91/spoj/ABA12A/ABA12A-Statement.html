<p>Balaji was reading number theory. When reading about primes, he was thinking about numbers which could be expressed as a product of primes. He wanted to know the largest number in a range which could be expressed as a product of primes. Balajiâ€™s maths teacher is not so good at maths and so he was taught that 1 is prime. You, being a good programmer, help him with the task.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input consists of C, the number of test cases, followed by C lines containing two space separated numbers a and b, the first and last number in the range (inclusive).</p> 
<p>1 &lt; C &lt; 100</p> 
<p>0 &lt; A &lt; B &lt; 1e12</p> 
<p>0 &lt; B - A &lt; 1e6</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the largest number which can be represented as a product of primes, considering 1 to be prime.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
1</pre> 
<pre>1 4

<strong>Output:</strong>
4</pre> 
<pre><strong>Explanation of test case: </strong>4 can be expressed as 2 x 2.</pre>
